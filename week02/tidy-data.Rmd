# Tidy data:
1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
table4a
```

## Gathering
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

```{r}
table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
```

```{r}
tidy4a <- table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "population")
left_join(tidy4a, tidy4b)
```

## Spreading 
```{r}
table2 %>%
    spread(key = type, value = count)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
